# Linux file system
In computing, a file system (often abbreviated to fs), controls how data is stored and retrieved.
Without a file system, data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins. 
By separating the data into pieces and giving each piece a name, the data is easily isolated and identified.

The structure and logic rules used to manage the groups of data and their names is called a "file system".

There are many different kinds of file systems. Each one has different structure and logic, properties of speed, flexibility, security, size and more. 
Some file systems have been designed to be used for specific applications.
