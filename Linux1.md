What is a Linux?

=> Linux is an open-source operating system like other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS, iOS, Google android, etc.
=> An operating system is a software that enables the communication between computer hardware and software. 
   It conveys input to get processed by the processor and brings output to the hardware to display it. This is the basic function of an operating system.
   Although it performs many other important tasks, let's not talk about that.

 Multiuser capability: Multiple users can access the same system resources like memory, hard disk, etc. But they have to use different terminals to operate.
 Multitasking: More than one function can be performed simultaneously by dividing the CPU time intelligently.
 Portability: Portability doesn't mean it is smaller in file size or can be carried in pen drives or memory cards. It means that it support different types of hardware.
 Security: It provides security in three ways namely authenticating (by assigning password and login ID), authorization (by assigning permission to read, write and execute) and encryption (converts file into an unreadable format).
